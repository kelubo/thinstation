# --- Settings for the hdd-spindown package
#
# hdd-spindown		A package that sets the hard drives into sleep mode, spins them down.
#			This is very good to use if you rarely access the hard drives,
#			e.g. if you use the package "local-install" then you use your drive
#			initially when you load the thinstation image from the hard drive, but
#			after that you don't use the hard drive and then it's a good idea to
#			put it into sleep mode (spin it down).
#
#			When I crated this package I had trouble to get the drive to actually spin down,
#			hence the logging feature... I finally got it working by setting SPINDONW_B=127
#			and SPINDOWN_S=60. I'm not entierly sure about how S and B but I realised that B=127
#			is usually a desired value since the drive then will work at a good preformance when
#			it is in use but setting S to a "to high" value resuled for me that the drive didn't
#			spin down. B=127 is about 10 minutes if I got the info correct and it seamd that you
#			needed to have S less than 10 minutes (120) so thereby I set it to 5 minutes (S=60)
#
# SPINDOWN_B		Default to 127. Possible values are between 1 and 255, low values mean more
#			aggressive power management and higher values mean better performance.
#			Values from 1 to 127 permit spin-down, whereas values from 128 to 254 do not.
#			A value of 255 completely disables the feature.
#			This value goes into the -B parameter of the "hdparm" command.
#
# SPINDOWN_S		Default spin-down idle time to 15 minutes. 1 to 240 specify multiples of
#			5 seconds and values from 241 to 251 multiples of 30 minutes.
#			This value goes into the -S parameter of the "hdparm" command.
#
# SPINDOWN_DEVICE	Default is /dev/sd? which will make all local drives spin down.
#			The device(s) you wish to put into sleep mode. You can use wildcard such as
#			? or even * but be carefule. A good example is to set it to /dev/sd? which
#			will have effect on all local drives.
#
#			You can test/verify the state of the drive by running "hdparm -C /dev/sda"
#			is should say "drive state is: standby". To wake the drive you can run "sync"
#			and then it should say "drive state is: active/idle"
#
# SPINDOWN_FORCE_AT_BOOT	This will force a spindown of the devices at boot. This is a normally
#			a good thing to do if you want do spindown the drives. If there are som configuration
#			issues with the B or S parameters this might help to actually spin them down anywhay,
#			at least initially...
#			This function never actually worked for me, I could hear at boot how the drive spinned down
#			but instantly spinned up again. But since the function was already written I kept it so you
#			you may try but don't hope to much... Work with the S and B values instead would be my sugesstion...
#
#
# SPINDOWN_LOGGING	This will enable extra logging info that writes info about the active
#			and standby time to "/var/log/messages". You can then use "grep hdd-spindown /var/log/messages"
#			to see when the drive enters standby mode.
#
SPINDOWN_B=127
SPINDOWN_S=60
SPINDOWN_DEVICE=/dev/sd?
#SPINDOWN_FORCE_AT_BOOT=ON
