# --- Settings for the custom-background package
#
# custom-background     A package that dynamically lets you via e.g. thinstation.conf.network specify what
#                       background-image should be used. This is useful because you can set one background
#                       in your build.conf and later on change the background. My usage (the reason why I created
#                       this package) was that I wanted a red background image with a warning text telling the
#                       user that he didn't receive the thinstation.conf.newtork settings and thereby the
#                       computer probably would not work, and instruct the user to reboot or contact support.)
#
#                       Then in the thinstation.conf.network you set another (the normal) background image.
#
#                       To use this package - from a URL address:
#                           1. Make sure the background image is available on a url and is a jpg file that can
#                              be used as a background.
#                           2. edit your config file (thinstation.conf.network) and set
#                              CUSTOM_BACKGROUND='http://MyWebServer/MyBackgroundFile.jpg'
#
#                       To use this package - with images built into your Thinstation build
#                          1. Copy all background images to /build/packages/custom-background/root/.custom-background/
#                             (actually, the path doesn't matter, just make sure the images are available on the
#                              client at boot-time)
#                           2. In build.conf make sure that package custom-background is included
#                           3. In build.conf set your default/fallback/warning background that shall be used
#                              e.g. CUSTOM_BACKGROUND=/root/.custom-background/warning-image.jpg
#                           4. In thinstation.conf.network set your normal/default background that the user
#                              normally shall see, e.g. CUSTOM_BACKGROUND=/root/.custom-background/normal-image.jpg
#                           5. Done!
#
# CUSTOM_BACKGROUND	The path for the background file to use.
