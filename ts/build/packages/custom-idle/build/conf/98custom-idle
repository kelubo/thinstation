# --- Settings for the custom-idle package
#
# custom-idle		A package that shuts down the computer if none
#			of the processes listed in IDLE_CHECK_FOR_PROCESSES
#			are running. For example, if you define:
#				IDLE_SHUTDOWN_MINUTES=30
#				IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL=5
#				IDLE_CHECK_FOR_PROCESSES="ica|wfica|chrome|xterm|bash"
#			the computer will automatically check for those
#			processes every 5 minutes and if none of the processes
#			have been active/running within the last 30 minutes
#			the computer will be shut down automatically. 
#
#			Default is to power off the computer but you can make it reboot
#			instead by setting
#				IDLE_SHUTDOWN_ACTION=reboot
#
#			To completly disable idle check set IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL=0
#
#
IDLE_SHUTDOWN_MINUTES=30
IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL=5
IDLE_CHECK_FOR_PROCESSES="ica|wfica|configmgr|chrome|xterm|xfce4-terminal|gnome-mplayer"
